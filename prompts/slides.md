## Tools Landscape

Generate a 14–16 slide deck for software engineering leaders and senior ICs (30–40 min talk).
Output format: for each slide, provide Title, 3–5 concise bullets, and Speaker Notes (2–4 sentences).
Structure: Title → Agenda → 4 sections → Summary → Q&A.

Focus: evolution from autocomplete to agentic coding systems that can read repos and run tools.
Include: Cursor IDE, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, plus 3–4 lesser-known tools (state why each is distinct).
Cover workflows: spec-driven development, agentic TDD, multi-agent orchestration, and review process changes.
Provide practical tips: prompting patterns, token/cost control, tool selection by use case.
Require user-friendly, clarifying, intuitive diagrams and graphs for complex concepts; specify the chart type when helpful.
End with forward-looking view: architecture, system design, and human judgment as differentiators.
Avoid marketing language; keep claims defensible and note uncertainty where relevant.

## Running Locally

Generate a 12–14 slide deck for engineers evaluating local LLMs.
Output format: Title, 3–5 bullets, Speaker Notes (2–4 sentences).
Structure: Title → Agenda → 3 sections → Summary → Q&A.

Cover: privacy/digital sovereignty, hardware fundamentals (VRAM vs model size, GPU tiers), and Apple Silicon unified memory.
Include: quantization strategies, practical performance tradeoffs, and top runtimes (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio).
Add a "pitfalls" section: bandwidth bottlenecks, thermal throttling, hidden telemetry, and mitigation steps.
Require user-friendly, clarifying, intuitive diagrams and graphs for complex concepts; specify the chart type when helpful.
Keep language concrete; avoid absolute claims. If stats are referenced, flag them as "cite sources."

## Downsides

Generate a 12–14 slide deck for engineering managers on risks/limits of AI in software development.
Output format: Title, 3–5 bullets, Speaker Notes (2–4 sentences).
Structure: Title → Agenda → 4 sections → Summary → Q&A.

Cover: technical debt accumulation, security regressions, cognitive biases, limited context windows, and limits of probabilistic reasoning.
Include effects on skills/mentorship and the need for guardrails (tests, code review, threat modeling).
Frame AI as a junior pair programmer, not autopilot; emphasize human oversight.
Require user-friendly, clarifying, intuitive diagrams and graphs for complex concepts; specify the chart type when helpful.
Avoid absolute statements; if citing studies or vulnerability rates, explicitly request citations.
