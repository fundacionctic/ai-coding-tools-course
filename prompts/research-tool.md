Conduct in-depth research on [AI TOOL NAME] using only official, first-party documentation and resources published or maintained by the tool’s creator (for example, OpenAI for Codex CLI, Anthropic for Claude Code, Google for Antigravity, and GitHub/Microsoft for GitHub Copilot), as well as GitHub repositories with a significant number of stars, explicitly excluding third-party blogs, tutorials, low-signal community posts, or secondary summaries, and focus on best-practice usage, core and advanced features, practical tips and tricks, and the knowledge required to get the most value from the tool in day-to-day software engineering workflows; include a clearly defined section on [AI TOOL NAME]–specific capabilities that meaningfully differentiate it from other AI tools commonly used in the software development ecosystem, and write in plain, user-friendly English for professional software engineers who are not AI experts while remaining factual, accurate, and technically correct, using concrete examples from real-world development scenarios—such as coding, debugging, testing, refactoring, and code review—where helpful.
