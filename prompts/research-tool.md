Conduct in-depth research on [AI TOOL NAME] using only official, first-party documentation and resources published or maintained by the tool’s creator (for example, OpenAI for Codex CLI, Anthropic for Claude Code, Google for Antigravity, and GitHub/Microsoft for GitHub Copilot), as well as GitHub repositories with a significant number of stars. Explicitly exclude third-party blogs, tutorials, low-signal community posts, marketing pages without technical substance, or secondary summaries. Base all descriptions strictly on documented behavior or clearly observable functionality.

Write in a factual, neutral, and technically grounded tone, avoiding marketing language, hype, or claims not directly supported by the documentation. Focus on best-practice usage patterns, core and advanced features, and practical operational guidance rather than promotional positioning. Prioritize real-world considerations such as setup and configuration, common workflows, integration points, limitations, performance and safety considerations, and typical pitfalls, emphasizing how the tool is actually used in day-to-day software engineering work.

Include a clearly defined section on [AI TOOL NAME]-specific capabilities that meaningfully differentiate it from other AI tools commonly used in the software development ecosystem, grounding all comparisons in documented features. Write in plain, user-friendly English for professional software engineers who are not AI specialists, while remaining precise and technically correct, using concrete examples from coding, debugging, testing, refactoring, and code review where helpful, and noting trade-offs or cases where alternative approaches may be more appropriate.
