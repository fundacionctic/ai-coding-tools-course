# AI Coding Tools Course

This repository contains documentation and references—primarily AI-generated using the Deep Research feature of Perplexity or Gemini—to support the knowledge base for a 2-hour course focused on AI coding tools and agentic IDEs such as Claude Code, Codex CLI and GitHub Copilot.
